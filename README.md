# Making Close

How we think about building products at Close.

To write a new blog post, simply follow the existing pattern inside [`_data/posts`](https://github.com/closeio/engineering.close.com/blob/master/_data/posts).
GitHub will automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages when something is pushed to master.

Note: It may take a bit for changes to appear live.

## Developing the site

The site uses the Gatsby static site genreator.

```
git clone git@github.com:closeio/engineering.close.com.git
cd engineering.close.com
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8000
